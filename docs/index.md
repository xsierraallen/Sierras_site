# **Hey Guys!**

Welcome to my GitHub Pages site! *:)*

My name is Sierra Allen and I am 19 years old. I am a first year student at Penn State Behrend. I plan on majoring in Biology, but I wanted to explore the world of Digital Arts and Technology as well.

My interests include photography, music, mild video editing, painting, and most things that include creativity; creativity is my forte. When I am not doing something that takes creativity, I’m usually out snowboarding or skateboarding. 

I am currently employed as a manager at a McDonald’s and I have been there since 2017. However, I don’t plan on spending the rest of my life there. My dream job is to work with marine life on the East Coast of America. I am planning on studying habitats and wildlife and being able to photograph these animals in their natural habitat. I want to make the world a better place for wildlife to thrive in and studying these animals will be my first step.

If you want a little insight into my life, I reccomend taking a look into my digital portfolio! You will be able to see my oldest and newest works of art and anything else in progress. If you want to take a look for yourself, click here! #[DigitalPortfolio](DigitalPortfolio.md)

Also, if you want to get a little more professional, you can take a look at my resume here... #[Resume](Resume.md)

My Digital Humanities class at Behrend has got me thinking about technology and which technigues I like to use better when creating my websites. I decided to write up a little essay containing my thoughts about GitHub and Sites.Psu.Edu. You can take a look at this essay through this link. #[ReflectionEssay](ReflectionEssay.md)
