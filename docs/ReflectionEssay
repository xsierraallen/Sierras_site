Lets talk about GitHub first. This is my first time working with websites and creating code to use for this platform. I must say, GitHub did make it pretty easy to put up a website. I love that I am able to share my Repository with others and follow any other user that interests me. GitHub is a cute little social media platform that not many people know about. I think that if you are a first timer in the digital arts world and your'e looking to get opinions on your work and help with your coding, this is the place to be. I am very excited to keep using this site to grow my portfolio and play around on my site. With this website, I had help from one of my college professors with all of my questions. This made making this site fairly easy. I feel as if I was joining GitHub and creating my repository on my own, I would need alot more guidance and for a first timer without any help, this site may be a little tricker. A few youtube tutorials can help here and there but somethings are harder than they seem.

However, Penn State Behrend Sites aka WordPress is fairly easy! I was able to create my site and style my layout within two days which was terrific! I believe Word Press may be easier for a beginner, atleast it was for me suring my experience. Pictures are easy to download and your blog posts are just a click away. Now every website is different just like every person. Everyone has their own preference and mine miht just be Word Press. I am very excited to start using both sites and within time I will get to know each program more and more. This will help me generate more of an opinion. If you would like to see my Word Press to get a little insight yourself, here it is! https://sites.psu.edu/sierraallen/
