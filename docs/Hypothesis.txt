Those times, most slaves could not read. While Turner learned to read the Bible as a child, and probably it’s the only Book he knew well, I can now understand why Turner relates his rebellion to biblical context. In his revelation, he correlates himself to the Old Testament prophets. He also quoted passages from the Bible. Gray’s record of Turner’s Confessions revealed Turner’s moral sense and justification of his rebellion, which is hard for me to grasp. Nat Turner’s rebellion had to be so intensely horrendous to send a message to the whites. Turner indeed caused others to take action against slavery. 	https://hyp.is/UT_WWgMwEeuLlJ89rwOZQw	http://www.americanyawp.com/reader/the-cotton-revolution/nat-turner-explains-his-rebellion-1831/#annotations:UT_WWgMwEeuLlJ89rwOZQw

Nat Turner understood his rebellion as an act of God. 	This statement definitely stood out to me. I can briefly understand the reasoning as he was trying to deliver a "message" by incorporating and leading a group of "colored" men to act against. However, killing innocent men definitely crosses the line and is an act of hatred. Delivering a message could be completed in different manners that does not elude to harming another being just for the sole purpose. Especially Turner stating that his rebellion occurred as "an act of God", this definitely raises some eyebrows. He is inferring that a message was delivered to him and to act upon it, this could have been done by "hearing things", in other words he was was hallucinating. 	https://hyp.is/xl5PVAMuEeup6_dU4DvNPw	http://www.americanyawp.com/reader/the-cotton-revolution/nat-turner-explains-his-rebellion-1831/#annotations:xl5PVAMuEeup6_dU4DvNPw

And on the 12th of May, 1828, I heard a loud noise in the heavens, and the Spirit instantly appeared to me and said the Serpent was loosened, and Christ had laid down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men, and that I should take it on and fight against the Serpent, for the time was fast approaching when the first should be last and the last should be first.	He didn't ask any questions, he followed through with what he asked for and what he saw, that is "Walking by Faith and Not by Sight." God and the Spirit will show you things when you pray and focus.

Several years rolled round, in which many events occurred to strengthen me in this my belief. At this time I reverted in my mind to the remarks made of me in my childhood, and the things that had been shewn me—and as it had been said of me in my childhood by those by whom I had been taught to pray, both white and black, and in whom I had the greatest confidence, that I had too much sense to be raised, and if I was, I would never be of any use to any one as a slave. Now finding I had arrived to man’s estate, and was a slave, and these revelations being made known to me, I began to direct my attention to this great object, to fulfil the purpose for which, by this time, I felt assured I was intended. Knowing the influence I had obtained over the minds of my fellow servants, (not by the means of conjuring and such like tricks—for to them I always spoke of such things with contempt) but by the communion of the Spirit whose revelations I often communicated to them, and they believed and said my wisdom came from God.	With this whole segment, when you often pray for something, and you are getting the same response from the "Spirit" every time, it is time to go through whatever it is telling you to do. I believe that is what Nat Turner felt, he even said he waited years before falling through with his plan to try to help his people. He also said, that he didn't trick their minds or anything in that nature. I've never been a slave, but I'm sure whatever they were going through, anyone would want to break free from that. 	https://hyp.is/tRuwJAMpEeuE2Avr8wdEag	http://www.americanyawp.com/reader/the-cotton-revolution/nat-turner-explains-his-rebellion-1831/#annotations:tRuwJAMpEeuE2Avr8wdEag
