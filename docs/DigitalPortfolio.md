What's up!

This is my digital portfolio. I don't have much to show you guys, but this portfolio will continue to grow as I make my way through college and pursue my career in the world of digital art.

I was able to make a YouTube channel to display my videos so anyone can see my content. If you are interested, try it out! [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJemmNK3ATpdiIrz_VbHPCg/about?view_as=subscriber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJemmNK3ATpdiIrz_VbHPCg/about?view_as=subscriber)

As for photography, I have a few pieces I am proud of. This collection will always continue to grow and I am proud that atleast one person other than myself can see my work.
