For my game analysis, I chose to play the game Aurore from the itch.io collection. This game initially interested me due to the fact that It was about a girl simply daydreaming. Aurore is the name of the character you play. The background describes her as a passenger on a train. Her journey is very long and restless so she falls into her thoughts and begins to dream of a world that does not exist. The objective is to make it through this obstacle course of a world and reach the other end, this is where she wakes up from her dream on the train.

The first area you spawn into is an outside world. Each object and structure in the game is broken into fragments. In Aurore’s dream, she is able to use her mind to shrink and grow objects. This helps you make your way through the world. As I began to walk through the world, I noticed that it was very hard to play on a laptop. As you use the mouse pad you are able to shift your point of view, this was very difficult for me because of the sensitivity. At times the game would lag and I would run myself off of a bridge or a cliff. My point of view would lag and I would not be able to go in the direction I desired but I eventually got the hang of it. In order to use Aurore’s powers, I had to hold down the right and left corners of the mouse pad and I was unable to run and perform this action successfully at the same time. Because of this, I switched to a wireless mouse for my laptop and it was easier to play. Once I got the hang of things I started out on the journey and it was actually very amusing for a computer game.

As I was able to look around the game I noticed a few things. The graphics in the game were quite beautiful. I assume a lot of work was put into this game and it shows very well. The colors of the world and the effects caught my attention the most. There was also a soundtrack that played throughout the game which was nice. Sound effects were also included such as the noise of a train. When objects shrink and grow there is a sound as well which was very realistic and I admired that. All in all, the sound went perfect with the scenery and game itself. 

There were times in the game where I began to walk but my trail ended so I needed to find a new way to keep going. By shrinking and growing objects such as rocks and bridges I was able to create my own path. As I came to the end of my road I fell through a bridge which helped me come across a new scenery in the game.

At this point I was able to travel through a building where I found a piece of a picture. I was able to collect this which was eventually stored in my “memories” in the game. When you get to the main menu of the game, there is a memories option. This shows you the pictures that Aurore found on her journey. I thought this part of the game was very interesting and it was something that was pretty original which I admired. After I made my way to the top of the building I crossed another bridge to get to the last scene. This place was very tricky to get through because there was no simple path to follow, you had to use your brain and think outside of the box. This game was a bit of a challenge which made me want to pla it even more.

On each side of this river there were glaciers of ice that blocked waterways. Using my powers, I was able to shrink and grow them and push them into the water and uncover the water flow. This helped raise the water level and made it easier for me to get to the other side of the world. This was the section that was harder than the rest for me but I eventually figured it out. Once I reached the end, there was a giant moon. By shrinking this moon, I was able to uncover the way out which was the end of the dream.

After I crossed this last bridge, the game was at its end. The whole game probably took me 15 minutes to complete which is fast, but it was still very interesting to play. If you’re looking for a quick game, I would recommend this one. The aspects of dreams are so surreal and they amaze me and the creator of Aurore really pulled their vision off. Oftentimes the human mind actually does think of scenarios such as this game which is easy to relate to. It is amusing to think of what powers we could obtain and puzzle solving is always fun and an easy way to exercise our brains.

The second game I chose to analyze was called, Where The Goats Are. In this game, the character is an old woman who lives on a farm. During this game you collect milk from goats to create your own cheese and you grow wheat to feed your animals. I only played this game for about 10 minutes and I believed it was going nowhere. Maybe there is more to the game, but I couldn't figure it out. The graphics were good which is an upside. However, I do not have much to say other than that. It is easy to relate to reality because this sort of thing happens every day on a farm, but it was not that amusing as a game. Maybe If I were to spend more time and maybe look at walkthroughs of other players on the game, I could make better sense of what to do. I feel as if this game is more about strategy and solving puzzles than Aurore was. Aurore is more about action and there is a destination to get to.

In this game, I was able to make things such as cheese and butter. I had to collect eggs from the chicken coup, I had to water my plants and get hay for my animals. Once the animals were fed I could milk them and then turn that milk into cheese by heating it up in a pot and stirring it over a fire. My actions just kept going around in circles and I was not sure where it was going, was there a purpose to all of this? Something that caught my eye however was in this game, there was day and night. Aurore did not have the option of day and night because it was a dream. In Where The Goats Are, I was able to put my avatar to sleep if I wanted the next day to come. When it was night time, it was extremely hard to see the screen and it made it very hard to play the game even with my full brightness on my laptop.

Once a day, a man with a large sack would walk past the house and up to the gate. He would stand there for a minute but by the time I got my character to walk over to the gate to see what the man wanted, he would walk away and disappear. I believe that I was supposed to interact with him in some way, but I never got the chance to. The character seemed as if I would be able to trade things with him like the cheese and buter I was making.

I probably would not play this game again because it is just not in my taste, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try it out for yourself. Maybe if I had more patience, I could have figured out the rest of the game but like I said I was not really getting anywhere and it was quite frusterating for me. This game compared to the game Aurore is vastly different. There is not much objective to this game like the last and the graphics are very different. The only thing that is relatable is the fact that you play in second person and you use the same avatar in the game. However, this game included more characters such as an old man with a sac and a few animals. You are also able to interact with various objects and perform different actions. There was many objects that I was able to interact with like carrying around sticks, cans and oepning things like doors and mailboxes in Where The Goats Are. Aurore did not have anyone else to interact with that was a living creature. The fact that the animals moved and did their own thing during the second game was actually pretty cool and did catch my interest. In Aurore the only movement I got was when I used my powers to shrink and grow things but I still couldnt carry anything with my hands like in the second game.

Looking at the two games, they are pretty similar when looking at the basics but have even more differences when you really analyze them. It is easy to see that both creators put alot of work into each game which is incredibly respectable. Each theme of the game fit their scenery very well and both games created a challange for the player which is something you want when playing any game. Looking at each game, there were a few flaws such as lagging, but that does not mean that the game itself is responsible for that. Basically both games were created very well and I applaud the creators for their visions. Games on Itch.io are definitly worth a try and I would reccomend the games this website offers to anyone.
