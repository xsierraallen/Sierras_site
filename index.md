# **Hey Guys!**

Welcome to my GitHub Pages site! *:)*

My name is Sierra Allen and I major in Biology at Penn State Behrend College. Yes, I'm a Bio major...however, I do dabble in Digital Arts and Technology. This site is going to give you insight on who I am and display some of my work for you guys to see. Have fun getting to know me!
